This project demonstrates how to create a **TypeScript interface**, use it to define student data, and then **render the data into a table** using **vanilla JavaScript** and **Webpack**.

## 📌 Task Summary

- Created an interface named **`Student`** containing:
  - `firstName: string`
  - `lastName: string`
  - `age: number`
